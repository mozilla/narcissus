To run narcissus with jstests.py, change to the js/src/tests/ directory and run
the following command (which excludes tests that are particularly slow):

  python jstests.py -d -j 4 $OBJDIR/njs -x slow-narcissus.txt


Currently, Narcissus is failing a number of tests.  narcissus-failures.txt can
be used to ignore those tests.  Note that narcissus-failures.txt also includes
all of the tests from slow-narcissus.txt.

  python jstests.py -d -j 4 $OBJDIR/njs -x narcissus-failures.txt
